# Notes on PixPlot experiments

Keep the sub-folder relatively clean. Take notes here. The searches are recorded in the JSON file queries.json in this same directory.

Comment: it's useful to have all files in a flat directory, for looking through them on my local machine. That's a powerful way to discover common or interesting themes. Say something methodological about this...


## Notes to be merged with Parley chapter

Also: should really use my Crusoe material from the HT talk. Does Parley say much about Crusoe? Would be a nice connection. Is Crusoe ever disabled?

Parley's Magazine has article on "Robinson Crusoe School" and de Fellenberg's methods. "Heart, head, and mind." Links to Holbrook's manual labor school.  

From bootcamp notes: Do Ted Underwood's literary time piece but for printed book illustrations. Is plates --> vignettes the same as decades --> minutes?

Parley's Tales about America copies woodcuts from Woodbridge, Rudiments of Geography and Bewick-ifies them.

1835 Parley's Magazine covers de Fellenberg's Crusoe school and Gallaudet's Hartford Asylum and the Perkins School. Same in Am. Journal of Education (later the Annals of Education). William Andrus Alcott serializes medical textbooks in Robert Merry's Museum. House I Live In, etc.

Hawthorne copies French ballooning article in AMUEK. His Universal History on the Basis of Geography begins with a balloon-eye view.

See Parley's Magazine 4 (1836) for how the educationists conceived of [the apparatus?].

nyp.33433066604343_00000250_00.jpg -- "First scene at Captain Barton's"

https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066604343&view=1up&seq=246

Volume: The Child's Friend (translated from Berquin; engraved by Alexander Anderson)

For a great essay on Berqin and this book: http://hockliffe.dmu.ac.uk/items/0069.html

Captain Barton dialogues with his subordinate sergeant Pipes, who lost a leg after it was hit by a musket ball.

Features: Uses the play/dialog format! Children would probably perform this.

"The Military Academy. Second Part. A Drama, In One Act."

"Scene 1: [...] Paul shoulders Pipes' crutch"

Compare to Peter Parley and Jacob Abbott's General Howitz. I already have a decent number of critical sources on prosthesis. See the one on Admiral Nelson in particular.

Wai Chee pointed out Poe's sendup of prosthetic masculinity to me: (very good!)
