nyp.33433066604343_00000250_00.jpg -- "First scene at Captain Barton's"

https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066604343&view=1up&seq=246

Volume: The Child's Friend (translated from Berquin; engraved by Alexander Anderson)

Captain Barton dialogues with his subordinate sergeant Pipes, who lost a leg after it was hit by a musket ball.

Features: Uses the play/dialog format! Children would probably perform this.

"The Military Academy. Second Part. A Drama, In One Act."

"Scene 1: [...] Paul shoulders Pipes' crutch"

Compare to Jacob Abbott's General Howitz. I already have a decent number of critical sources on prosthesis. See the one on Admiral Nelson in particular.
