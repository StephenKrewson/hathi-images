# Krewson HTRC Update Post

*from Ryan:*

As requested and only (!) a couple of weeks late, here are links to some example blog posts from a group from our last ACS round:

- https://newreadia.wordpress.com/2018/10/10/extracting-and-organizing-htrc-corpora-tool-and-walkthrough/
    - Presents "Program Era Project" extractor tool that tries to get ISBN and other metadata and puts it into JSON form (from zipped pairtree)
- https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/programera/2018/02/09/breaking-down-the-htrc-data-capsule/
    - Basic graphs on (multi)authorship for Iowa Workshop study; basic "data profile" and plan for further text analysis
- https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/programera/2017/11/20/collaborating-with-hathitrust/
    - In-depth drive of StyleCard and LitMap (data shown in plot.ly)

Youâ€™ll see that the focus of the posts varies, as does the length and the depth to which results are discussed. Whatever makes sense for the progress of your project will almost certainly work for us, but let me know if you have any questions or if you wanted to share a draft in advance, even. Sharing a draft is definitely not required, though.

## Pipeline

Things worth going into a bit more detail on:

- Pairtree
