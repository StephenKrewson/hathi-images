Who I am

Slides

The example. Which clusters are examined. &c.



Takeaways

- The two-pass approach works!
- Good low-dimensional representations are a moving target; best to prioritize the image data along with the essential contextual metadata
- Use the right tools for the right job: PixPlot takes that basic metadata and raw image data and does something very useful with it (even identifying clusters). Furthermore, PixPlot continues to add different projections and ways of viewing image data.
- A 50-year sample is not tractable for individuals or small teams. Ideally, Hathi would start to keep metadata about estimated image regions. But 50 years is great for then going in with more focused research questions. And publishers are a great unit of analysis, because that's really the point at which image assets are materially acquired and used.
