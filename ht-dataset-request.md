## Requesting and retrieving a dataset

Datasets are available from HathiTrust only by request. If your request is approved, then you will be given access to an rsync endpoint from which you can transfer and synchronize the files. Rsync is a protocol for transferring files. See "Retrieving Datasets via rsync" for specific instructions on downloading datasets.

If you want to ask questions prior to submitting the research proposal described in step 3 below, please send an email to [feedback@issues.hathitrust.org](mailto:feedback@issues.hathitrust.org) to start a conversation.

### The request process

1. Determine which dataset you would like to request access to. Even if you want to sync a subset of volumes, you will be granted access to the endpoint for the entire dataset. Your options are:

   - Public domain, excluding Google-digitized volumes: all available volumes you can access based on your location, but does not include Google-digitized volumes. Datasets are either ht_text_pd_open_access (for US-based researchers) or ht_text_pd_world_open_access (for researchers outside the US).
   - All public domain, including Google-digitized volumes: all available volumes you can access based on your location, including Google-digitized volumes. Datasets are either ht_text_pd (for US-based researchers) or ht_text_pd_world (for researchers outside the US).

2. For those requesting Google-digitized volumes, check whether your institution has signed the Distribution Agreement with Google

   - If not, determine who the authorized sponsor is at your institution. Because of liability and indemnification terms in the agreement, review from legal counsel could be needed. Interested researchers should begin this process as soon as possible. Contact legal counsel at Google, Tamar Fruchtman, [tamarf@google.com](mailto:tamarf@google.com), to begin the process.
   - If so, review the [Distribution Agreement with Google](https://www.hathitrust.org/sites/www.hathitrust.org/files/Google_PD_Distribution_Agreement_template_2019.docx) to understand what your responsibilities are.

3. Send a brief proposal in an email message to

   feedback@issues.hathitrust.org

   that specifies:

   - The name, institutional affiliation, and country of residence of all researchers who will contribute to the research project
   - The dataset to which you would like to have rsync access
     - Public domain, excluding Google-digitized volumes (ht_text_pd_open_access or ht_text_pd_world_open_access)
     - All public domain, including Google-digitized volumes (ht_text_pd or ht_text_pd_world)
     - Note: If you would like to sync only a subset of data relevant to your work but are unsure which of the datasets contains the items you desire, provide either a characterization of the desired texts (dates, languages, subjects, etc.) or details about the specific volumes requested (either in the form of a link to a public HathiTrust Collection or a list of HathiTrust volume IDs). Someone will help you determine which dataset is both best for your needs and is available to you based on the access limitations described elsewhere on this page.
   - What research is to be done
   - What the result outputs will be
   - How the research outputs will be used
   - Whether or not you give permission for HathiTrust to share the details of your proposal
     - Note: With your permission, we may share your proposal with other researchers as an example if asked, or describe the details of your proposal to other HathiTrust users. We will not post your proposal online. In all cases, we reserve the right to describe how datasets have been used by recipients, based on publicly-available information, including linking to research outputs from HathiTrust dataset usage.

4. Sign and return the researcher agreement that applies to the data you are requesting. [print these]

5. When your request is approved, we will ask you to send a static IP address. Once your access is cleared, then you will be able to rsync the data you have requested only from that IP address.
